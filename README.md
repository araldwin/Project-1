## Purpose of the project
This Private beach house website was made for portfolio project #1 (HTML&CSS) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
## user stories
as a developer, I want to be able to inform and show users how beautiful the place is, so they can experience what it feels like to vacation in a private beach house and enjoy it with family, or friends.
