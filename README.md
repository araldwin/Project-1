## Typography and color scheme
### Typhography
- I used two fonts in this project, they are Monserrat and Lato, Monserrat for Headings and Lato for the rest, with both fall backs being Sans-serif. This Font is simple and adapted to the website and it is linked to the CSS document via @import.

### Color Scheme
- in this website I used colors blue violet #8A2BE2, sky blue #87CEEB, blue #0000FF, white #FFFFFF, yellow #FFFF00, and black #000000 for the font-texts. and other specified colors such as beige #F5F5DC, cultured #F5F5F5 are for the background of other elements, and red for the Contact us Icon. I used these colors to match and have a beach house atmosphere. so that the user can clearly read such a website it is cool to the eyes and relaxing color.
